# Homebrew cask for DeskMate.
#
# This file belongs in a tap repository, not here — Homebrew reads casks from
# `Casks/` in a repo named `homebrew-<tap>`. Copy it to
# `Jolie-Ni/homebrew-tap/Casks/deskmate.rb` on release; it lives in this repo so
# the version and checksum are updated in the same commit as the build that
# produced them.
#
#   brew install --cask --no-quarantine jolie-ni/tap/deskmate
#
# The flag is not optional while the build is unnotarized: Homebrew quarantines
# casks by default, so without it the app hits the same Gatekeeper wall as a
# browser download. A cask cannot waive that on the user's behalf, by design.
# What the cask does buy is one command instead of a trip through System
# Settings, plus a clean uninstall path.
